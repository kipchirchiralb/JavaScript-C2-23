The CLI (Command Line Interface) is a text-based interface used to interact with a computer's operating system or software applications. Here are some commonly used CLI commands:

1. `cd` - Change directory: This command is used to navigate between directories. For example, `cd Documents` will take you to the Documents directory.

2. `ls` - List files: This command lists the files and directories in the current directory.

3. `mkdir` - Make directory: This command creates a new directory. For example, `mkdir my_folder` creates a new folder called "my_folder".

4. `rm` - Remove: This command is used to delete files or directories. For example, `rm file.txt` will delete the file named "file.txt".

5. `cp` - Copy: This command copies files or directories. For example, `cp file.txt ~/Documents` will copy the file "file.txt" to the Documents directory.

6. `mv` - Move: This command moves files or directories. For example, `mv file.txt ~/Documents` will move the file "file.txt" to the Documents directory.

7. `pwd` - Print working directory: This command displays the current directory.

8. `cat` - Concatenate: This command displays the contents of a file. For example, `cat file.txt` will display the contents of the file "file.txt".

9. `grep` - Global regular expression print: This command searches for a specific string of text in a file. For example, `grep "hello" file.txt` will search for the word "hello" in the file "file.txt".

These are just a few examples of commonly used CLI commands. There are many more commands available depending on the operating system and software being used.
